✅ AI INTERVIEW SYSTEM - ENHANCED WITH PERSONALIZATION
================================================================================

PROBLEM SOLVED:
- AI was asking repetitive, generic questions
- Questions didn't reference candidate's actual resume details

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Resume-Aware Question Generation
2. 8 Rotating Question Styles
3. Natural Interview Flow
4. Specific References to Companies, Projects, Skills

================================================================================
INTERVIEW FLOW
================================================================================

Greeting → Resume Discussion → Projects Deep-Dive → Behavioral → Technical → Closing

Each section now uses SPECIFIC resume data to create personalized questions.

================================================================================
EXAMPLE QUESTIONS
================================================================================

BEFORE (Generic):
❌ "Tell me about your experience with React"
❌ "What projects have you worked on?"
❌ "Describe a technical challenge"

AFTER (Personalized):
✅ "I see you worked at Google as a Senior Engineer. Can you tell me about 
   the Kubernetes infrastructure you built there?"

✅ "Your E-commerce Platform project using React and Node.js sounds interesting. 
   What was the biggest technical challenge when handling 10K concurrent users?"

✅ "In your ML Recommendation Engine project, why did you choose TensorFlow 
   over PyTorch? What alternatives did you consider?"

================================================================================
WHAT THE AI NOW KNOWS
================================================================================

✓ Candidate's Skills: Python, React, Node.js, AWS, Docker, etc.

================================================================================

3. Technical Deep         - "Explain how... works"
4. Project Walkthrough    - "Walk me through..."
5. Problem-Solving        - "If you encountered X, what would you do?"
6. Opinion-Based          - "What do you think about..."
7. Comparison             - "What's the difference between..."
8. Experience-Specific    - "In your work with X, how did you..."

Each question uses a DIFFERENT style than the previous one!
